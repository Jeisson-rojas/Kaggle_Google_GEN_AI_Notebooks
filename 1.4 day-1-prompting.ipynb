Every afternoon, he surveyed his domain from the window, judging the neighborhood squirrels with haughty disdain. Every evening, he cuddled up with his human, a plump, middle-aged woman named Ms. Agatha, for a pre-bedtime cuddle.\n",
            "\n",
            "But Bartholomew, beneath his air of feline boredom, harbored a secret: a yearning for adventure. One day, a particularly daring squirrel, sporting a jaunty acorn cap, climbed the oak tree in Ms. Agatha's yard. Bartholomew, his whiskers twitching with excitement, followed the squirrel's ascent. He climbed with an agility that surprised even himself, leaping from branch to branch, his claws finding purchase in the rough bark. \n",
            "\n",
            "At the very top, the squirrel, its tail held high, challenged Bartholomew with a cheeky chatter. Bartholomew, emboldened by his unexpected success, accepted the challenge. He gave chase, scrambling through the branches, his emerald eyes fixed on the scurrying prize. \n",
            "\n",
            "The squirrel, however, led him on a dizzying chase through the neighborhood, across fences and rooftops, Bartholomew's heart thumping with exhilaration. He navigated a precarious trellis, narrowly avoiding a startled robin, and even braved a quick, terrifying dash across a busy street. \n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, the squirrel led him to an abandoned greenhouse, its glass panes cracked and overgrown with weeds. Bartholomew, panting and dusty, was about to give up when he heard a faint, plaintive meow. He cautiously peeked inside, his tail brushing the dusty window sill. \n",
            "\n",
            "There, huddled in a corner, was a tiny ginger kitten, its fur matted and its eyes filled with fear. Bartholomew, despite his own weariness, felt a surge of protective instinct. He nudged the window pane, and the kitten looked up, its eyes wide with wonder. \n",
            "\n",
            "Bartholomew, with a gentle purr, nudged the kitten towards a gap in the broken windowpane. The kitten, hesitantly at first, then with increasing confidence, followed him out. \n",
            "\n",
            "Back in Ms. Agatha’s garden, the kitten, now cleaned and fed, snuggled up to Bartholomew, purring contentedly. Bartholomew, gazing at the setting sun, realized that adventure wasn’t just about chasing squirrels. It was about unexpected encounters, surprising discoveries, and perhaps most importantly, about finding a friend. \n",
            "\n",
            "And as Ms. Agatha, who had been out shopping, finally returned, she was greeted by the sight of her Bartholomew, not alone on the porch as usual, but accompanied by a tiny ginger kitten. \n",

            "Bartholomew, with a proud flick of his tail, knew this was just the beginning of their adventures together.  \n",

Here's a breakdown of what it does and why you'd use it:\n\n**What it is:**\n\n* **Bash-Git-Prompt:** This script enhances the default bash prompt by adding information related to your current Git repository.  Think of it as a power-up for your terminal when using Git.\n* **Highly Customizable:**  The script offers a wide range of options to tailor the prompt to your preferences, including:\n    * **Themes:** Different color schemes for visual appeal.\n    * **Information displayed:**  Branch name, upstream status, staged changes, unstaged changes, etc.\n    * **Symbols:** Customize the symbols used to represent different states (e.g., ahead, behind, conflicts).\n    * **Prefixes and suffixes:**  Add extra text before or after the prompt.\n* **Cross-Shell Compatibility:** The script aims to work with both Bash and Zsh.\n* **Dynamic Update:** The prompt automatically updates based on changes in your repository.\n\n**Why you'd use it:**\n\n* **Improved Git Workflow:**  The prompt gives you quick, visual feedback about your repository's status without needing to constantly run `git status`.\n* **Enhanced Productivity:**  By providing key information directly in your prompt, it helps you work with Git more efficiently.\n* **Clarity and Organization:** The prompt provides a more structured and visually appealing way to manage your Git workflow, especially in complex projects.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **Branch Status:** Shows the current branch name and its status (e.g., ahead of upstream, behind upstream, conflicts).\n* **Upstream Tracking:** Indicates if a branch is tracking a remote branch and the relative status.\n* **File Status:**  Displays information about changes (staged, unstaged, untracked) and conflicts.\n* **Custom Themes:** Choose from built-in themes or create your own.\n* **Virtual Environment Support:** Integrates information about active Python, Node, and Conda environments.\n* **Prompt Customization:** Fine-grained control over prompt elements, colors, and symbols.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n1. **Installation:**  Download or clone the script to your system.\n2. **Add to Your Shell Configuration:** Source the script within your `.bashrc` (for Bash) or `.zshrc` (for Zsh).\n3. **Customize:**  Adjust the settings and theme to your liking.\n\nThis script essentially automates the process of providing a rich, informative Git prompt, making your daily Git workflow more efficient and visually appealing. \n"
